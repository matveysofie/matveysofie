  <samp>I'm a Backend developer. A highly resourceful computer programmer and well-rounded IT professional with over two years. 
  I have been swimming in the IT industry for about five years, but I have 2 years of commercial experience. For personal interest, I got acquainted with the interface frameworks: VueJS, React, Quasar. But still, I prefer to work and develop in the backend direction more.
